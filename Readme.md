Assumptions:

1. A scalable implementation of distributed storage which certainly levels of scalability, reliability and availability.
   * Google Cloud Storage would run on hundreds / thousand of machines
   * Built on top of inexpensive hardware
     * Failures are considered the norm since baseline hardware could cause system fauld like : Disk Failures, Networking,  
     * 
     * 
     *   Memory and CPU issues, human failure and etc. Due to this nature , continuous monitoring is also a requirement.
